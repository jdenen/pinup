;;; Commentary:

;; Pinup provides functions to support a dedicated, ever-present window
;; for visibility and easy access.  For a full description and examples
;; of its use, see the `README.md' file packaged with pinup.el.

;; This library provides easy management of dedicated windows.  A
;; dedicated window is one which will not display another buffer in
;; it.  This library refers to dedicated windows as "pinned." See
;; README for more details.
